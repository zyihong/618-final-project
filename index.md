|  | Status | Task | Assignee |
| --- | --- | :-- | --- |
| Week 1 - 4 | Finished | Figure out how to use the complier for OpenMP 4.5 ASAP, start an OpenMP implementation. |  |
| | Finished | Complete an OpenMP CPU implementation that can reasonably scale. |  |
| | Finished | Have a working OpenMP on GPU and profiling results. |  |
| Week 5 1st half | Working | Implement the red-black coloring version. |  |
| | | Implement the 4D blocking layout version. |  |
| | | Comparing and testing the performance and tuning using OpenMP constructs to better utilize the GPU. |  |
| Week 5 2nd half |  | Try to convert part of the OpenMP GPU to CUDA code, expecting this to  address some inefficiency observed. |  |
| Week 6 |  | Report the performance gain of each iteration. If time permits, explore the CUDA implementation. |  |
